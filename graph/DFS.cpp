    // Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. They are primarily used in sequences of numbers, characters etc. They reduce the complexity and execution time of the program.
    // 1. begin() :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.
    //2. end() :- This function is used to return the after end position of the container.
    //The main advantage of an iterator is to provide a common interface for all the containers type.
    // syntax : <ContainerType> :: iterator;  

// Vector of Vectors is a two-dimensional vector with a variable number of rows where each row is vector. Each index of vector stores a vector which can be traversed and accessed using iterators.

// A pair is a container which stores two values mapped to each other, and a vector containing multiple number of such pairs is called a vector of pairs.
